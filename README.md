A phone conversation simulator with your mother. 

Made for COMM-420: Design of Play with Lindsay Grace. 

I took the class on a whim, to say the least, but I grew so much as a designer, a storyteller, and a programmer in some regards. My intentions were to recreate the experiences I and so many other friends and family have talking to our parents over the phone.
